## SIGNAL INJECTOR
This circuits produces a very handy signalinjector. It is a free-running multivibrator with an output of square wave form at a fundamental frequency of about 2kHz and thus is rich in harmonics and can provide a continuous note when injected into any receiver, up to about 20MHz. The signal injector can be fitted into a plastic tube about 10 to 15 cm long so before cutting the veroboard it is best to find a container. A small plastic pill bottle is ideal and the veroboard can be cut to size. The probe can merely be a long thin bolt mounted in the centre of the lid. To find a fault in an amplifier or superhet radio, simply connect the earth lead to the chassis of the amp and move through each stage starting at the speaker. Obviously an increase in volume should be heard at each preceeding stage. This injector will also go through the IF stages of radios and FM sound sections in TV's. Use 2 mercury button batteries for the supply and fabricate a switch into the screw-on lid. The first use for this injector will be to test the operation of the next project...The MINI AMPLIFIER.
